# Flower Card

# BREAKING CHANGES

>**Warning**
>
> **This card is about to be completely rewritten.  Versions > 2.0.0 will *not* be compatible with the original plant integration in HA or with earlier releases of this integration.**


This fork of the flower-card depends on this patch to the internal Plant component:
https://github.com/Olen/homeassistant-plant

Instead of reading the max/min-values from the huge data-file, it gets the values from the plant entity, using a websocket connection.

## Version 1 

Version 1 of this card has been deprecated and requires Version 1 of https://github.com/Olen/homeassistant-plant

The rest of this readme describes Version 2 of this card

## Version 2

Several new sensors from the new version of the plant integration has been added to the card. 

The card also now use websockets to retrieve extended information about the plants from the backend.
